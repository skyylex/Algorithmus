# Algorithmus

##### Common algorithms and data structure written in Swift. 

At current stage it's just for fun framework, not production-ready code. It's main purpose to demonstrate Swift in algorithmic way and some algorithms in very expressive way. =)

## Goals and principles:

- Swift only
- Generics support for containers
- As simple as possible (no linked frameworks)
- Each part of framework need to have an example

## Data structure list 
#### Implemented:
- Binary tree
- Stack

#### Todo:
- Queue

## Algorithms list:
#### Todo:
- Search
- Sort
